Running Coach
=============
A running app that provides users with timers for each workout of the C25K and B210K running programs.

A buzz will alert you about the end of a running or walking interval and you will also be able to pause or switch the current interval.

The app also allows you to tell the watch to vibrate at an interval of your choice (e.g. 5 minutes) - useful for running, meditating, and cooking steaks.
